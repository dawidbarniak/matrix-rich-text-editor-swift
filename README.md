# Matrix Rich Text Editor for Swift

This package contains most of the source code powering our rich text editor. It takes over from [matrix-org/matrix-wysiwyg-composer-swift](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-wysiwyg-composer-swift).

It is composed of: 
* Static libraries generated from Rust, packaged in a XCFramework.
* Swift bindings to interact with these libraries.
* Components built on top of these bindings.

This repo is only used to release the original RTE repo on Swift Packager Manager.
